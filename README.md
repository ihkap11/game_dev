Leaning 2D game development in JavaScript as a beginner in JavaScript. 

Currently making a single player game on HTML Canvas. Idea is to make a multiplayer 2D game and then use self-learning (PPL Algorithm) to train the game. 

Plan:
- Stage 0:
-- Make 2D single player web-game.
- Stage 1:
-- Modify the single player game to a multiplayer web-game.
- Stage 2:
-- Do a rough system design on how to get environment of the web-game and feed it into the RL algorithm.
-- Brainstrom more and don't give up!
- Stage 3:
-- Work on the RL algorithm- Try implementing from scratch first?
-
-
-
- Stage N: .... TBD

Current stage: stage 0
